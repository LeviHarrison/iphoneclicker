# iphoneclicker
Yesterday at school I noticed cookie clicker was popular again, so I decided to code my own version of it, except with iPhones. It only took me about two hours to finish the game (keep in mind this was my first Javascript project ever), and then I spent some editional time tinkering with it to fix stuff like image sizes.
